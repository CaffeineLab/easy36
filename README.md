# EASY36
Easy 36 is a simple project that is meant to be a rosetta stone for working with date/time formats between languages.  Rather than digging through Python or PHP Documentation for the string representation of a date's UTC Timezone offset, and then generating formatting strings for communicating between APIs, this tool provides you with a way to click around until you get it right.  It also provides you with the detailed lookup information as found in the language documentation.  And finally - 36?  It's a 10 code to provide the current time of day.
    
Site providing insight to string formatting among languages.  Goal is to provide a simple click-editable map of all of a languages datetime format string so you can easily build the format you need.  Currently supporting Python's strftime() formatting tokens.
